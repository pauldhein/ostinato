![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/pauldhein/ostinato/lint-test-docs.yml?logo=githubactions)

This repository implements the SIATEC algorithm for finding patterns in musical melodies. The algorithm is described in the publication [COSIATEC and SIATECCompress: Pattern discovery by geometric compression](http://www.titanmusic.com/papers/public/MeredithMIREX2013.pdf). The name of this package comes from the Italian word ostinato that is commonly used in music to refer to motifs that repeat within a musical piece.
